### Case to solve
To write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions:**
- The computer thinks of a number from 0 to 100 and we need to guess it. By 'guess' we mean to write a program, that guesses the number.
- The algorithm takes into account whether the random number is greater or less than we need.

**Quality metric**
Results are evaluated by the everage naumber of attempts at 1000 repetitions.

**Practice**
Learning how to write good code in Python
