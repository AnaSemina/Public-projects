### Case to solve
To write a program that guesses the number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Task conditions:**
- The computer thinks of a number from 0 to 100 and we need to guess it. By 'guess' we mean to write a program, that guesses the number.
- The algorithm takes into account whether the random number is greater or less than we need.
- The [baseline](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k2WZD8PWWOYFHrpAJoB2eZw06ID7KnFA) template from the screencast presented

**Quality metric**
Results are evaluated by the everage number of attempts at 1000 repetitions. A minimum number of attempts is required (less than 20).

**Practice**
- Learning how to write good code in Python.
- Learning to work with IDE.
- Learning to work with Github.
